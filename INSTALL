Requirements
============

Gina depends on the following software:

    * GTK+ 2.14

You'll need to install the development files (i.e. the headers) in order
to compile Gina.


Build and install
=================

You can compile and install Gina using the usual command sequence

    ./configure
    make
    make install (as root)

Provided you have the needed header files and tools, that should be it.
