Requirements
============

Gina depends on the following software:

    * GTK+ 2.14

I haven't checked thoroughly, however since Gina uses only a small fraction
of the features provided by the GTK+ library, mostly pretty basic stuff, it
should be possible to make it work with older versions of GTK+ as well.


Build and install
=================

You can compile and install Gina using the usual command sequence

    ./configure
    make
    make install (as root)

Provided you have the needed header files and tools, that should be it.
