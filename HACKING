Gina is written in Vala, so if you plan to hack on the source code, you'll
need to install the Vala compiler.

I'm currently using Vala 0.5.6 for development; since Vala is such a
quickly evolving language, I can't guarantee compatibility with any other
version. I plan, however, to keep on updating the code to make it work
with the latest Vala release.
