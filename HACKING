Gina is written in Vala, so if you plan to hack on the source code, you'll
need to install the Vala compiler. The provided C source files are just for
convenience, and patches against them will not be considered for merging.

I'm currently using Vala 0.5.5 for development; since Vala is such a
quickly evolving language, I can't guarantee compatibility with any other
version. I plan, however, to keep on updating the code to make it work
with the latest Vala release.

Due to a bug in Vala 0.5.6 and 0.5.7, it's not possible to compile Gina using
those versions. The bug (GNOME #570872) has been fixed in Vala 0.6.0.
