New in Gina 1.0.0
=================

    * Re-implemented from scratch in Vala.

    * Added a menubar, which can be toggled on and off.

    * Added the ability to turn off window decorations (not guaranteed to
      work with every window manager).

    * Use the GNU autotools for the build system.
